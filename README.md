# Room-Database

Room Database

The majority of Android applications necessitate local data storage. This has been accomplished in recent years through the use of SQLite databases. Room is a persistent library included with the Android jetpack. It is built on the SQLite database. There are numerous advantages to using the room persistent library over raw SQLite.

One advantage is that it eliminates the need for a developer to write a lot of boilerplate code to create and manage databases. It also validates SQL queries at compile time.

This means that if there is a SQL query error, the application will not compile. This keeps the developer from running into run-time errors.

This publication walks you through the process of developing an Android app that uses the room persistent library to create and manage SQLite databases.
